This repository contains program files from coding I did when I was young. These programs are not everything, but best represent my projects at the time.

## Python
I did a bit of python, and wrote a calculator (located in python/calculator.py)

## Html/Javascript
I also worked on various Html/Javascript projects, mostly using the <canvas> tag, and programming small games.
Two are included:

#### CollisionDetection
After learning about the Pythagorean Theorum in math class, I decided to make a little program with two circles, one of which is the player, the other a stationary circle. The circles change color when in contact with eachother.

#### BubbleGame
This game involved two circles, a big one controlled with arrow keys by the player, and a smaller circle that bounced around. As the player collects circles by touching them, they
 get bigger. There is no explicit end goal, however after a certain point the player is so big the game resets automatically.
 
## Arduino
These were my favorite projects, as they combined my interest in programming with my interest in engineering. I have included two of my favorites.

#### Keyboard
This project had a series of buttons connected to an arduino, along with a piezo(simple speaker). When certain buttons were pressed, different tones were played.

#### Robotic arm
This project was both more complicated, and less. The programming was not as intense, but the engineeing aspect was. This program was the controls for a physical robotic arm, 3D designed and printed by me. More info can be found at skippysunday.net
